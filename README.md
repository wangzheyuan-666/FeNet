# FeNet: Feature Enhancement Network for Lightweight Remote-Sensing Image Super-Resolution 

This repository is for FeNet introduced in the following paper

Wang, Zheyuan and Li, Liangliang and Xue, Yuan and Jiang, Chenchen and Wang, Jiawen and Sun, Kaipeng and Ma, Hongbing, "FeNet: Feature Enhancement Network for Lightweight Remote-Sensing Image Super-Resolution" in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, [[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9759417)]

  


The code is built on IMDN and RCAN  (PyTorch).  See [IMDN](https://github.com/Zheng222/IMDN) and [RCAN](https://github.com/yulunzhang/RCAN) for details
